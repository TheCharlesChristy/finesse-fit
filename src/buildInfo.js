/**
 * Which build this device is running.
 *
 * The three constants are replaced at build time by Vite's `define` (see
 * vite.config.js). They exist so Settings can answer "is the change I just
 * merged actually on my phone, or is Safari still serving a cached build?" —
 * package.json's version never moves, so the commit and the build time are the
 * parts that actually identify a build.
 *
 * The `typeof` guards keep this importable anywhere the defines aren't applied
 * (a plain Node script has no `define`). Vite substitutes the literal before
 * the check runs, so nothing is lost in a real build.
