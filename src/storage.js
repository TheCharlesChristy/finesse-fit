/**
 * Persistent storage and quota, for an app whose only copy of your data is here.
 *
 * Finesse Fit has no server. Everything lives in one browser's IndexedDB, which
 * browsers treat as evictable by default — under storage pressure, or after a
 * long enough gap without a visit, "best effort" data can simply be deleted.
 * `navigator.storage.persist()` asks for the "persistent" bucket instead, which
 * is only cleared if the user clears it themselves.
 *
 * Whether the request is granted is entirely the browser's call and varies by
 * engine: Chrome grants it on engagement signals, Firefox prompts, and Safari
 * grants it to home-screen web apps. So this reports what actually happened
 * rather than promising an outcome, and every export degrades to a value the UI
 * can explain where the API is missing.
 *
 * Nothing here is called on load without a reason: `persist()` can prompt in
 * some browsers, so it is only ever triggered from an explicit user action in
 * Settings, matching how the barcode-scanner camera permission is handled.
